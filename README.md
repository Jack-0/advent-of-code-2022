# Advent of code

[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about) (AOC) presents a programming challenge on each day of advent. The problems vary in difficulty and are great way to learn a new language or test your current knowledge.

**I highly recommend doing AOC if you enjoy programming.**

## Project format

`year` `=>` `language` `=>` `README.md`
